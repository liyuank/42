/*
**  Write a program that takes a string and displays the words
**	separated by a single space.
**	The last word will be followed by a '\n' (even if there is none).
**	There will be no spaces before the first or after the last word.
**	A word is a string separated by either spaces or tabulations,
**	or the start or the end of the string.

**	If there are no parameters, epur_str displays '\n'.
